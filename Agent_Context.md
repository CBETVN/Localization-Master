## What Is This?

**LocalizationMaster** is a **Adobe Photoshop UXP plugin** that automates the translation of text inside **Smart Objects and plain text layers** in PSD files. The workflow targets game UI production — PSD files contain translatable text (either inside Smart Objects or as direct text layers) that need to be translated into multiple languages using a pre-prepared Excel translation table.

## State Management

All state lives in `main.jsx` (App component). **No external state library** — plain React `useState`.

| State | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `languageData` | `Object` | Keys = language codes (EN, DE, BG...), values = arrays of translation strings |
| `availableLanguages` | `Array<string>` | Language codes parsed from Excel header row |
| `selectedLanguage` | `string` | Currently selected target language |
| `isDataLoaded` | `boolean` | Whether Excel was successfully parsed |
| `suggestions` | `Array<{id, text, placeholder}>` | Translation suggestions for the selected layer |
| `selectedId` | `number\|null` | Currently selected suggestion ID |
| `isProcessing` | `boolean` | Guards async operations |

The `appState` object bundles the first 4 into a single prop passed down to components/functions that need context.

## Excel Translation File Format

The Excel file has this structure:

```
| EN          | DE          | BG          | SK          | ...  |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------|
| FREE SPINS  | FREISPIELE  | БЕЗПЛАТНИ   | ZADARMO     | ...  |
| YOU WIN     | SIE GEWINNEN| ПЕЧЕЛИТЕ    | VYHRÁVÁTE   | ...  |
| TOTAL WON   | GESAMT      | ОБЩО        | CELKOVO     | ...  |
```

- Row 0 = language codes (column headers). Special columns like `Screen Preview` are ignored.
- Row 1+ = translation pairs. EN column is the lookup key; other columns are translations.
- `languageData["EN"][i]` corresponds to `languageData["DE"][i]` — **index-aligned arrays**.
- Multi-word phrases appear as a single cell. Multi-line phrases (e.g. `FREE\nSPINS`) are split and individual lines matched separately.

---

## PSD File Conventions

### Clean Convention
- **Parent group name = translation key** (e.g. group named `FREE SPINS` contains SOs `FREE` and `SPINS`, or direct text layers)
- Group name matches EN lookup table entries almost exactly
- Individual SO and text layer names are word fragments for layout/animation, not keys
- Translated versions (BG layer group) have SOs renamed / text layers updated to the translated word (Cyrillic)
- Some SOs or text layers are tagged `(DO NOT TRANSLATE)` in their name — must be skipped

### Sloppy Convention
- SO and text layer names are meaningless (`enRed`, `bgBlue`, `free copy`, ` FREE SPINS` with leading space)
- **Parent group names are still descriptive** (`outroCreditsWonLandscape Rome`, `freeSpinsCounterAttila`)
- The group name contains the meaning but has extra words (scene context, character name)
- Requires fuzzy normalization to extract the actual translation key from the group name

### Convention Variant — "Clean with noise"
This is a middle ground observed in practice and represents the most common real-world case. The core rule still holds: **the parent group name is the translation key**, and the layers inside are messy. However several complications arise:

- **Double SO instances**: each phrase group typically contains two SOs pointing to the same underlying Smart Object (e.g. one inside a `Group 3` subgroup, one sitting directly in the parent named `"X copy"`). They share the same `smartObjectMore.ID`. The plugin must **deduplicate by SO ID** and translate only once. Text layers do not have this problem — each is a unique layer.
- **Intermediate wrapper groups**: SOs and text layers are often nested inside unnamed intermediate groups (`Group 3`, `Surface`, `txt only`, etc.) before reaching the translatable layer. Traversal must go deep enough to find the actual SO or text layer.
- **Language group naming variants**: instead of plain `EN` / `BG`, groups may be named `EN_popup` / `BG_popup`. Matching must use `startsWith("EN")` or `includes("EN")` rather than an exact string check.
- **Phrase concatenation in group names**: a group may be named `congratulations you win` — a combined name covering two separate phrases inside it. The plugin should not try to match this combined name directly but instead descend and match subgroups (`you win`, `congratulations`).
- **Direct ungrouped SOs/text layers**: some translatable layers (e.g. `"10 free spins for"`, `"of"`) sit directly inside the EN/BG group with no phrase subgroup wrapping them. Their own layer name is the lookup key, not a parent group.
- **Plain TEXT layers mixed in**: some scenes use direct text layers (not SOs) for translation (e.g. infobar `gameBet` section). These have `layer.kind === "text"` and `layer.textInfo.text` contains the current content. They are translated directly without entering edit mode.
- **PascalCase group names**: some groups use `CreditsWon` instead of `credits won` — normalization must handle both spaced-lowercase and PascalCase forms when matching against the EN lookup table.

### Target Layer Types
The plugin must handle **both**:
- **Smart Objects** — text is inside a nested document; requires entering edit mode to translate
- **Plain text layers** — `layer.kind === "text"`; translated directly via `layer.textItem.contents` without entering any edit mode

### Matching Strategy (intended, partially implemented)
1. **Pass 1 — Parent group name match**: Normalize group name (trim, uppercase, strip scene suffixes) → look up in EN table
2. **Pass 2 — Layer name match**: Normalize SO/text layer name → look up in EN table
3. **Pass 3 — Inner text content**: Enter the SO (or read `textItem.contents` for plain text layers) → use as lookup key

## Core Functions

### `photoshop.js`

**`translateSmartObject(smartObject, translation)`**
- Handles Smart Objects: enters edit mode via `batchPlay` (`placedLayerEditContents`), finds all text layers inside, sets `textItem.contents`, restores original `impliedFontSize` via batchPlay (workaround for a PS bug that shrinks font on text change), then saves and closes the SO document
- Plain text layers can be translated directly without entering edit mode — just set `layer.textItem.contents` and restore font size in place

**`editSmartObject(smartObject)`**
- Opens a Smart Object for editing via batchPlay `placedLayerEditContents`

**`getAllLayers(layers)`**
- Recursively flattens the layer tree into a flat array

**`getLayerInfo(layer)`**
- Returns raw batchPlay descriptor for a layer (includes `smartObjectMore.ID` for deduplication)

**`doesSelectedSOhaveInstances(layer)`**
- Checks if a Smart Object has multiple instances by comparing `smartObjectMore.ID` across all layers

**`getParentFolder(layer)`**
- Returns `layer.parent.name` — used for group-name-based matching

**`isLayerAGroup(layer)`**
- Returns true if layer is a group with children

### `parsingLogic.js`

**`parseExcelFile(fileOrArrayBuffer)`**
- Accepts UXP file object or ArrayBuffer, reads via SheetJS, calls `extractLanguageData`

**`isNameENPhrase(layerName, appState)`**
- Checks if a string exactly matches any EN entry (after normalizing whitespace and filtering `()[]{}` lines)

**`compareLayerNameToEN(layer, appState)`**
- Uppercase comparison of `layer.name` against all EN phrase lines

**`matchingPhrase(layer, appState)`**
- Finds the translated phrase for a layer by matching `layer.name` to EN entries and returning the corresponding index in the selected language array

**`translateSelectedLayer(appState)`**
- Gets active layer, runs `matchingPhrase`, calls `translateSmartObject`

**`translateAll(appState)`** *(WIP)*
- Iterates all layers, tries parent-folder match via `isNameENPhrase`, falls back to `compareLayerNameToEN`
- Not yet fully wired up to actually call `translateSmartObject`

**`parseForTranslation(text)`**
- Splits a phrase by `\n`, trims lines, filters out lines containing `()` or `[]`

---

## Known Issues / WIP Areas

- `translateAll` is partially implemented — matching logic runs but translation dispatch is incomplete
- `LoadFURLButton` URL is hardcoded to `null` (disabled)
- `SuggestionsContainer` footer buttons (Apply All / Apply Selected) are commented out
- `handleGenerate` in `main.jsx` uses dummy random data — needs to be wired to real `languageData[selectedLanguage]`
- Font shrink bug: Photoshop shrinks font size when setting `textItem.contents` — workaround in `translateSmartObject` restores `impliedFontSize` via batchPlay
- Multiple debug `console.log` statements throughout codebase

---

## Important UXP Gotchas

- **`executeAsModal` is required** for any Photoshop document modifications. Always wrap PS writes in it.
- **Layer references go stale** after entering `executeAsModal`. Always re-fetch layers by ID inside the modal scope using `getAllLayers().find(l => l.id === savedId)`.
- **SheetJS** is loaded as a UMD global — access it via `window.XLSX`, not as an ES import.
- `photoshop` and `uxp` modules are UXP-specific `require()` calls — they are shimmed in `globals.js` to avoid errors in non-UXP environments (e.g. browser preview mode).
- The plugin supports a `VITE_BOLT_WEBVIEW_UI=true` env flag for browser-based UI development (renders a dummy view instead of the real plugin UI).
